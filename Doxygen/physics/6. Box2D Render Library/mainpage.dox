This library consists of a simple class `CBox2DRenderer` that
will help you draw Box2D bodies using circles and lines in
<a href="../sage/index.html">SAGE</a>.
To use it you only need to call `CBox2DRenderer::Drawb2Body()` with a pointer to
an instance of `b2Body`. Read the rest of code to learn how
to access the parts that make up a `b2Body`.
