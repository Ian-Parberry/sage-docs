The Stroop Test Game makes the classical Stroop Test into a
game with completely gratuitous and totally unnecessary 
sound, physics and visual effects. 
The player is presented with a sequence of words colored either red, green, or blue
and is required to hit one of three keys depending on the color of the current word.
The catch is that the words are the English words "red", "green", and "blue",
which may or may not actually match their color.

If the player hits the key corresponding to the word's actual color
(the left arrow for red words, the up arrow
for green words, and the right arrow for blue words),
then it explodes into individual letters that in turn explode
individually into little copies of themselves which shrink down to nothing and vanish.
Any missed words descend to the bottom where they bounce around and eventually explode
in their own time. Explosions generate clouds of smoke and collisions generate bubbles
that blow about in the wind created by explosions and passing words.
