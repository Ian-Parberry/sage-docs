# 1. Introduction

\anchor fig1

The _Stroop Test_ 
is used as a measure of attention in standardized psychological tests.
The participant is presented
with a series of words randomly chosen from "red", "green", and "blue".
These words are randomly colored either red, green, or blue, which
means that the colors don't necessarily match the words.
The participant has to say the word, _not_ the color it is drawn in.
For example, the word "blue" in \ref fig1 "Fig. 1"
is colored green, but the participant must say "blue".
This is harder than it sounds.
Studies have shown that participants take longer to complete the test than they
would to recognize just words and colors alone. 
The Stroop Test Game makes the classical Stroop Test into a
game with completely gratuitous and totally unnecessary 
audiovisual effects including sound, particle effects, and physics (see
\ref fig2 "Fig. 2").

The remainder of this page is divided into five sections.
\ref section2 "Section 2" lists the controls
and their corresponding actions,
\ref section3 "Section 3" tells you how to build it,
\ref section4 "Section 4" gives you a list of actions to take in the game to see some of its
important features,
\ref section5 "Section 5" gives a breakdown of the code,
and
\ref section6 "Section 6" addresses the question "what next?".

# 3. Building the Game

This code uses <a href="../sage/index.html">SAGE</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D">Box2D</a>.
Make sure that you have followed the
<a href="../install/index.html">SAGE Installation Instructions</a>
and the <a href="../installphysics/index.html">Box2D Installation Instructions</a>.
Navigate to the folder <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;">`12. Stroop Test Game`</span> in your
copy of the <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;">`sage-physics`</span> repository.
Run <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;">`checkenv.bat`</span>
to verify that you have set the environment
variables correctly.
Open <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;">`Stroop Test Game.sln`</span>
 with Visual Studio and build the Release configuration.
Alternatively, run <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;">`Build.bat`</span>
to build both Release and Debug configurations.

# 4. Game Play

\anchor fig3
\image html word.png "Fig. 3: A colored color word dropping from the top of the window." width=60%

After a few explanatory pages have been displayed
the main part of the game begins and a series of colored words
drops from the top of the window, passing through horizontal regions marked
_excellent_, _good_, and _fair_ at the left of the window. The player
must hit a key (see \ref section2 "Section 2") corresponding to the word
(not its color) before the word falls to the bottom of the window and goes
out of play, at
which time it turns black and spawns a cloud of bubbles.
Only one word will be in play at a time and
that word will be the only one that is red, green, or blue (see \ref fig3 "Fig. 3").
If the player manages to hit the correct key before the word
goes out of play, then the word will explode, generating a smoke cloud
and a spray of letters in all directions.
The bubbles, which are totally gratuitous except
for serving as a distraction to the player, drift generally upwards and
are blown about by passing words and by explosions.

At the bottom of the window is a score bar that keeps track
of, from left to right,
the number of words dropped,
the number exploded in the _excellent_ region,
the number exploded in the _good_ region,
the number exploded in the _fair_ region,
the number that the player got wrong (hitting the wrong key).
the number that the player missed (not hitting a key before the word goes out of play),
and a somewhat dubious score (which can be negative) computed from these statistics. 
As you might expect, you get more points for correctly exploding a word
in the _excellent_ region than you do for exploding a word in the
_good_ region, which in turn gives you more points than you
do for exploding a word in the _fair_ region. This means that you
must be both fast and accurate to get a high score.
Out-of-play words at the bottom of the screen will eventually explode but
do not contribute to the score. These unexpected explosions are yet another
distraction to the player, as is the fact that the image of John Ridley Stroop
(the inventor of the Stroop test)
at the right of the window moves its eyes to follow the current word in play.

The bubbles mentioned in the previous paragraph are
blown about by a _vector field_.
We place evenly spaced grid points throughout the play area,
and at each point we store a floating point _pressure_ and a
vector (hence the name _vector field_). Pressure is increased in front of a falling word and reduced behind it.
For example \ref fig4 "Fig. 4" shows in various shades of brown, with
darker shades indicating higher pressure.

\anchor fig4
\image html pressure.png "Fig. 4: Air pressure (darker means higher pressure)." width=60%

The vectors point from grid points with higher pressure
towards a nearby area with lower pressure, as shown in \ref fig5 "Fig. 5".
The magnitude of each vector is proportional to the pressure difference.

The grid points are also shown with the vectors in  \ref fig6 "Fig. 6".

These effects are not intended for use in the game - they are just there to show programmers
what is going on behind the scenes. They can be toggled on an off using
the function keys listed in \ref section2 "Section 2".
