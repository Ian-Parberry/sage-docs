<p>This project consists of a collection of basic shapes that can be collided. It's not intended to be a full collision module, but it will give you a sense of some of the math and physics used in collision detection and response. It's implemented as a separate project that compiles to a library file that is linked into the <a href="../collisionmath/index.html">Collision Math Toy</a> and the <a href="../pinball/index.html">Pinball Game</a>. Note that unlike the code in the <a href="../pool/index.html">Pool End Game</a>, the collision detection and response code here does not compute exact responses, but instead computes an approximation using faster methods. As a result, tunneling and overlap may occur.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section2"></a></p><h1>2. Keyboard Controls</h1>
<p>This project compiles into a library, so there are no keyboard controls here.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section3"></a></p><h1>3. Building the Library</h1>
<p>This code uses the DirectX12 Toolkit. Make sure that you have followed the instructions in <a href="../install/index.html#directxtk12">Section 3</a> of the <a href="../install/index.html">SAGE Installation Instructions</a>. Note that this project is independent of <a href="../sage/index.html">SAGE</a>. Navigate to the folder <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>2. Shapes Library</code></span> in your copy of the <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>sage-physics</code></span> repository. Run <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>checkenv.bat</code></span> to verify that you have set the environment variables correctly. Open <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>Shapes.sln</code></span> with Visual Studio and build the Release and Debug configurations. Alternatively, run <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>Build.bat</code></span> to build both Release and Debug configurations.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section4"></a></p><h1>4. Game Play</h1>
<p>There's no executable file to run here, remember, it just compiles into a library file. If you're interested, the library files are <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>x64\Release\Shapes.lib</code></span> and <span style="background-color:#D8E4D8;"><code>x64\Debug\Shapes.lib</code></span>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5"></a></p><h1>5. Code Breakdown</h1>
<p>All of the code in this library is in a namespace called <code>Shapes</code>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-1"></a></p><h2>5.1 Helper Functions</h2>
<p><code><a class="el" href="_shape_math_8h.html" title="Handy math functions for the collision module.">ShapeMath.h</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="_shape_math_8cpp.html" title="Handy math functions for the collision module.">ShapeMath.cpp</a></code> contain some handy helper functions for this project. Since this project is independent of <a href="../sage/index.html">SAGE</a>, some <a href="../sage/index.html">SAGE</a> functions are duplicated here. Of particular interest is <code>FailIf</code>, which will be used inside functions in this project to test a Boolean condition and bail out from the function returning <code>false</code> if the condition is <code>true</code>. </p><pre class="fragment">#define FailIf(x) if(x)return false; 
</pre><p> This will make our code easier to read when we have multiple failure points within a function.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="fig1"></a></p><div class="image">

<div class="caption">
Fig. 1: AABBs (green) for a circle and an arc.</div></div>
<p>An <em>axially aligned bounding box</em> (AABB for short) is a minimal-size rectanle that bounds a shape and has its edges parallel to the X and Y axes. For example, <a class="el" href="index.html#fig1">Fig. 1</a> shows the AABB for a circle and an arc. AABBs are used in narrow phase collision detection to quickly and efficiently reject things that are too far apart to collide. Our AABBs are implemented by a class <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_aabb2_d.html" title="2D Axially Aligned Bounding Box.">Shapes::CAabb2D</a></code>, which has two private member variables of type <code>Vector2</code>, <code>Shapes::CAabb2D::vTopLeft</code> and <code>Shapes::CAabb2D::vBottomRt</code> which store the coordinates of its top left and bottom right corners as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig2"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="corners.png" alt="" width="40%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 2: An AABB is defined by its top left and bottom right corners.</div></div>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-2-1"></a></p><h3>5.2.1 Building AABBs</h3>
<p>AABBs can be built by creating one that encloses a single point using the overloaded assignment operator <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_aabb2_d.html#a32633ea446b6ac2acb2c69d0fa872b4b" title="Set AABB to point.">Shapes::CAabb2D::operator=()</a></code>, and expanding them to include a new point using <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_aabb2_d.html#aa1da21e24ab7ae58b7406db9ac930b50" title="Add point to AABB.">Shapes::CAabb2D::operator+=()</a></code>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-2-2"></a></p><h3>5.2.2 AABB Intersection Tests</h3>
<p>There are two intersection tests involving AABBs which are implemented by overriding <code>Shapes::operator&amp;&amp;</code>. The first one returns <code>true</code> if two AABBs have non-empty intersection: <a href="_a_a_b_b_8h.html#ae71c3550e2d92b21fd23bc51c34bf4d0"><code>bool operator&amp;&amp;(const CAabb2D&amp;, const CAabb2D&amp;)</code></a>. The best way to think about this is to consider how this function fails, that is, how two AABBs don't intersect. Suppose we have two AABBs \(A\) and \(B\), and that \(A\) has top left corner \([a_l, a_t]\) and bottom right corner \([a_r,a_b]\) and \(B\) has top left corner \([b_l, b_t]\) and bottom right corner \([b_r,b_b]\). One way that \(A\) and \(B\) can be drawn without overlap is for \(A\) to be completely to the left of \(B\), as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig3">Fig. 3</a>, in which case \(a_r &lt; b_l\).</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig3"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="aabbintersect.png" alt="" width="25%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 3: AABB intersection test.</div></div>
<p>Similarly, \(A\) could be completely to the right of \(B\), in which case \(a_l &gt; b_r\); \(A\) could be completely above \(B\), in which case \(a_b &gt; b_t\); or \(A\) could be completely below \(B\), in which case \(a_t &lt; b_b\). These are the only ways that \(A\) can not overlap \(B\). Therefore \(A\) and \(B\) don't intersect iff  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
(a_r &lt; b_l) \vee (a_l &gt; b_r) \vee (a_b &gt; b_t) \vee (a_t &lt; b_b),
\]
</p>
<p>That is, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">De Morgan's Law</a>, \(A\) and \(B\) <em>do</em> intersect iff  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
(a_r \geq b_l) \wedge (a_l \leq b_r) \wedge (a_b \leq b_t) \wedge (a_t \geq b_b).
\]
</p>
<p>This AABB intersection test is therefore extremely fast, using at most four floating point comparisons and three logical operations.</p>
<p>The second AABB intersection test returns <code>true</code> if a point is inside an AABB: <a href="_a_a_b_b_8h.html#a1f0ed51adcd95498db5fe30237772fc1"><code>bool operator&amp;&amp;(const CAabb2D&amp;, const Vector2&amp;)</code></a>. Suppose the AABB has top left point \([u_x, u_y]\), bottom right point \([v_x, v_y]\), and the point to be tested for intersection with it is \(\vec{p} = [p_x, p_y]\), as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig4"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="ptinaabb.png" alt="" width="20%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 4: Point in AABB test.</div></div>
<p>Then \(\vec{p}\) is inside the bounding box iff  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
(u_x \leq p_x) \wedge (p_x \leq v_x) \wedge (v_y \leq p_y) \wedge (p_y \leq u_y)
\]
</p>
<p>The point-in-AABB intersection test is also extremely fast, using at most four floating point comparisons and three logical operations.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-3"></a></p><h2>5.3 Shape and Motion Types</h2>
<p>The Shapes library has four main shapes: point, line segment, circle, and arc. There is also a line shape for internal use only. Shape types are identified using <code><a class="el" href="_shape_8h.html#a709ea6b747b4002fa997395a7e3cb1c7" title="Shape type.">Shapes::eShape</a></code>, defined in <code><a class="el" href="_shape_8h.html" title="Interface for CShapeDesc and CShape.">Shape.h</a></code>. It also has three motion types, static, kinematic, and dynamic.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Static shapes neither move nor rotate and are not affected by collisions.</li>
<li>Kinematic shapes do not move but can rotate about a static point. They are not affected by collisions.</li>
<li>Dynamic shapes (currently only circles) can move and rotate fully and are affected by collisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Motion types are identified using <code><a class="el" href="_shape_8h.html#ab2faf0dd4a4af61cb33b9b071da938d0" title="Shape motion type.">Shapes::eMotion</a></code>, also defined in <code><a class="el" href="_shape_8h.html" title="Interface for CShapeDesc and CShape.">Shape.h</a></code>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-4"></a></p><h2>5.4 Basic Shapes</h2>
<p><code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_shape_common.html" title="The shape common variables class.">Shapes::CShapeCommon</a></code> <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_shape_desc.html" title="Shape Descriptor.">Shapes::CShapeDesc</a></code> <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_shape.html" title="Shape.">Shapes::CShape</a></code></p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-5"></a></p><h2>5.5 Collision Detection and Response</h2>
<p>Shapes that can collide with other shapes will have a <code>CollisionDetected</code> function that takes a reference to an instance of the contact descriptor <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_contact_desc.html" title="Contact descriptor.">Shapes::CContactDesc</a></code> that has been initialized with a pointer to the current shape <code>m_pShape</code> and a pointer to the dynamic shape (currently only dynamic circles are implemented) <code>m_pCircle</code>. If the two shapes overlap, <code>CollisionDetected</code> will fill in the other member variables of the contact descriptor as follows and return <code>true</code>. The point of intersection (the coordinates of the point at which the shapes first collided, which is usually between frames) is computed in the 2D vector <code>m_vPOI</code>, the collision normal is computed in <code>m_vNorm</code>, the setback distance (the distance that the dynamic shape must be moved back along the collision normal to its position at the time of impact) is computed in <code>m_fSetback</code>, and the collision speed is computed in <code>m_fSpeed</code>. The main difference between collision detection and response in this project as opposed to the previous one (<a href="../pool/index.html">The 8-ball Pool End Game</a>) is that here the POI will be approximated by the closest point on the shape to the center of the dynamic circle. This is an outrageous fudge, but it looks right in practice and is faster to compute than the alternative.</p>
<p>Shape classes will have various intersection functions that detect overlap with other shapes. Dynamic shapes (the only shapes that can currently react to a collision) They will have a <code>CollisionResponse</code> function that takes as parameter a constant reference to a contact descriptor provided by some call to a <code>CollisionDetected</code> function.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-6"></a></p><h2>5.6 Lines</h2>
<p>Infinite lines are implemented as class <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html" title="Line shape.">Shapes::CLine</a></code>, which is for internal use only, that is, for computations internal to the Shapes library. For this reason, <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html" title="Line shape.">Shapes::CLine</a></code> has no <code>CollisionDetected</code> or <code>CollisionResponse</code> functions, neither does it have any functions to do with updating any member variables, translation, or rotation. It is the only shape that does not have a descriptor and is not derived from <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_shape.html" title="Shape.">Shapes::CShape</a></code>. <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html" title="Line shape.">Shapes::CLine</a></code> stores a gradient \(m\), inverse gradient \(1/m\), \(x\)-intercept \(c\), and \(y\)-intercept \(b\). A vertical line has gradient \(m = \infty\) (implemented as <code>float::Inf</code>), \(1/m = 0\), and \(b = \infty\). A horizontal line has gradient \(m = 0\), \(1/m = \infty\), and \(c = \infty\).</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-6-1"></a></p><h3>5.6.1 The Line Constructor</h3>
<p>The <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html" title="Line shape.">Shapes::CLine</a></code> constructor takes two parameters, a point \(\vec{p}\) and a floating point gradient \(m\), and initializes its member variables to represent the line of gradient \(m\) through point \(\vec{p}=[p_x, p_y]\). That is, its gradient is \(m\), its inverse gradient \(1/m\), its \(y\)-intercept is \(p_y - p_xm\), and its \(x\)-intercept is \(p_x - p_y/m\).</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-6-2"></a></p><h3>5.6.2 Point of Intersection of Two Lines</h3>
<p><code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html#a32f494b4360d19a5db531079fdd78785" title="Get intersection point with line.">Shapes::CLine::Intersect</a></code> computes the point of intersection between two lines. If both lines have the same gradient, then there is no point of intersection and the function returns <code>Vector2(Inf, Inf)</code>. Otherwise, if neither lines are vertical, and the lines have equations \(y=m_0x + c_0\) and \(y=m_1x+c_1\) as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig5">Fig. 5</a>, then the \(x\)-coordinate of the point of intersection of the lines satisfies the equation \(m_0p_x + c_0 = m_1p_x+c_1\), that is, \(p_x = (c_1 - c_0)/(m_0 - m_1)\). The \(y\)-coordinate of the point of intersection is therefore \(p_y = m_0p_x + c_0 = m_0(c_1 - c_0)/(m_0 - m_1) + c_0\).</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig5"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="lineline1.png" alt="" width="30%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 5: Intersection of two nonvertical lines.</div></div>
<p>Otherwise, one of the lines is vertical and the other is not. Suppose the first line is vertical and has equation \(x = c_0\), and that the second line has equation \(y=m_1x+c_1\). Let the point of intersection \(\vec{p}\) have coordinates \([p_x, p_y]\) as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig6">Fig. 6</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig6"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="lineline2.png" alt="" width="30%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 6: Intersection of a line with a vertical line.</div></div>
<p>Then \(p_x = c_0\) since \(\vec{p} = [p_x, p_y]\) is on the vertical line \(x = c_0\). Therefore \(p_y = m_1 c_0 + c_1\) since \(\vec{p}\) is on the line \(y=m_1x+c_1\). The case where the second line is vertical and the first line is not vertical is similar.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="section5-6-2"></a></p><h3>5.6.2 Point on Line Closest to Another Point</h3>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig7"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="lineclosestpt0.png" alt="" width="40%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 7: Gradient of perpendicular line.</div></div>
<p>Let \(\triangle ABC\) be the triangle shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, where \(\overline{AB}\) has equation \(y=m_0x + c_0\), where \(\overline{BC}\) has equation \(y=m_1x + c_1\), and \(\overline{AC}\) lies along the positive \(X\)-axis. Let \(\theta = \angle BAC\). Drop a line perpendicular from \(B\) down to a point \(D\) the \(X\)-axis (shown in blue in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig7">Fig. 8</a>). Then, \(\tan \theta = d_y/d_x\) (also shown in blue), that is, rise over run, and so \(m_0 = \tan \theta\). Notice that \(\angle BAC = 90^\circ - \theta\) (shown in green in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). Therefore, the angle from the positive \(X\)-axis to \(\overline{BC}\) is \(90^\circ - \theta\) (shown in red in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). Since \(\overline{AB}\) has equation \(y=m_0x + c_0\), by an argument similar to the above, \(m_1 = \tan 90^\circ + \theta\). Therefore,  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
m_1 = \tan (90^\circ + \theta)
= \frac{\sin (90^\circ + \theta)}{\cos (90^\circ + \theta)}
=- \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
=\frac{-1}{\tan \theta}
=\frac{-1}{m_0}.
\]
</p>
<p>Therefore, as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig8">Fig. 8</a> the closest point on a line \(L_0\) with gradient \(m\) to a point \(\vec{p}\) can be found by computing the point of intersection of the line \(L_0\) with the line \(L_1\) with gradient \(-1/m\) through point \(p\). \(L_1\) is constructed using the <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html" title="Line shape.">Shapes::CLine</a></code> constructor (see <a class="el" href="index.html#section5-6-1">Section 5.6.1</a>) and its point of intersection with \(L_0\) is computed using \(L_0\)'s <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_line.html#a32f494b4360d19a5db531079fdd78785" title="Get intersection point with line.">Shapes::CLine::Intersect</a></code> function (see <a class="el" href="index.html#section5-6-2">Section 5.6.2</a>).</p>

<p>Points are implemented as class <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_point.html" title="Point shape.">Shapes::CPoint</a></code>, derived from <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_shape.html" title="Shape.">Shapes::CShape</a></code>. They are instantiated using the descriptor <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_point_desc.html" title="Point descriptor.">Shapes::CPointDesc</a></code>. <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_point.html" title="Point shape.">Shapes::CPoint</a></code> has, in addition to constructors, a collision detection function <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_point.html#a7c238672005132e54bf1d4cada2db30d" title="Collision detection.">Shapes::CPoint::CollisionDetected</a></code> which, as noted in <a class="el" href="index.html#section5-5">Section 5.5</a>, takes as parameter a reference to an instance of <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_contact_desc.html" title="Contact descriptor.">Shapes::CContactDesc</a></code> initialized with a pointer to a dynamic circle and fills in the POI, collision normal, and setback distance.</p>

<div class="caption">
Fig. 9: A slowly moving circle colliding with a point (left) and the POI, impact normal, and setback distance (right).</div></div>
<p>If we assume that the circle and the point are moving relatively slowly, then the point will be only a short distance in from the edge of the circle when the collision is detected, as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig9">Fig. 9</a>, left. In that figure the circle (in green) has radius \(r\) and center point \(\vec{p}_1\) (blue) and it is moving at velocity \(\vec{v}\) rightwards and slightly down (purple) towards point \(\vec{p}_0\) (red). <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_point.html#a7c238672005132e54bf1d4cada2db30d" title="Collision detection.">Shapes::CPoint::CollisionDetected</a></code> computes \(\vec{p} = \vec{p}_1 - \vec{p}_0\), the vector from \(\vec{p}_0\) to \(\vec{p}_1\). A collision is detected when \(||\vec{p}|| &lt; r\). The POI is taken to be the coordinates of \(\vec{p}_0\) at the time the collision is detected, the setback distance is taken to be \(r - || \vec{p} ||\), the collision normal is taken to be \(\hat{p}\), and the collision speed is \(||\vec{p}_0 ||\). These are mostly not the correct values but, as we will see later in the <a href="../collisionmath/index.html">Collision Math Toy</a> and the <a href="../pinball/index.html">Pinball Game</a>, are usually close enough.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>However, if our assumption that the circle and the point are moving relatively slowly is incorrect, then there are a number of things that can go wrong. For example, the circle could completely travel through the point without a collision being detected (tunneling), or it could travel almost competely through the point as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig10">Fig. 10</a>, left (in which case the circle will be reflected in the wrong direction), or \(\vec{p}_0\) could be very close to or equal to \(\vec{p}_1\) as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig10">Fig. 10</a>, right (in which case we may get a divide-by-zero).</p>

Let \(\vec{v} = \vec{u} - \vec{p}\) be the vector from \(\vec{p}\) to \(\vec{u}\). Let \(\hat{v_0}\) be the unit vector that points along the tangent from \(\vec{p}\) to \(\vec{p}_0\) and let \(\hat{v_1}\) be the unit vector that points along the tangent from \(\vec{p}\) to \(\vec{p}_1\).

Fig. 16: First point of intersection on tangent through a point.</div></div>
<p>Consider the first of these points \(\vec{p}_0\). Consider the triangle with vertices \(\vec{p}\), \(\vec{p}_0\), and \(\vec{u}\) as shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig16">Fig. 16</a>. The length of the hypotenuse \(d\) is equal to the length of the vector \(\vec{v}\) from \(\vec{p}\) to \(\vec{u}\), that is, \(d = ||\vec{u} - \vec{p}||\). Let \(\delta\) be the length of the tangent through \(\vec{p}\) and \(\vec{p}_0\). Since the triangle is a right triangle, we know by the Pythagorean Theorem that \(\delta^2 + r^2 = d^2\), that is, \(\delta = d^2 - r^2\). Also since the triangle is a right triangle, the tan of the angle \(\theta\) shown in blue in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig16">Fig.16</a> is \(r/\delta\), and therefore \(\theta = \arctan (r/\delta)\). The angle between the positive \(X\)-axis and the line between \(\vec{p}\) and \(\vec{u}\) is \(\phi = \arctan(v_y/v_x)\), shown in green in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig16">Fig.16</a>. Therefore, the angle between the positive \(X\)-axis and the tangent is \(\theta + \phi\), and \(\hat{v_0} = [\cos(\theta + \phi), \sin(\theta + \phi)]\). Then to get from point \(\vec{p}\) to point \(\vec{p}_0\) we need to go a distance of \(\delta\) in the direction of \(\hat{v}_0\), that is, \(\vec{p}_0 = \vec{p} + \delta \hat{v}_0\).</p>

J. Casey, <em>A sequel to the First Six Books of the Elements of Euclid</em>, pp. 31-32, 1888 notes that you can shrink both circles by the same amount and maintain exactly the same tangents. As observed in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig18">Fig. 18</a>, right, you can shrink the smaller (yellow) circle down to a single point while shrinking the larger (green) circle down to radius \(r_0 - r_1\).

<img src="arcdesc.png" alt="" width="35%"/>
<div class="caption">
Fig. 20: Arc angles, points, and tangents.</div></div>
<p>Arcs are defined by a pair of angles, for example, the angles \(\alpha_0\) and \(\alpha_1\) shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig20">Fig. 20</a>. Note that at all times we will ensure that the stored values of these angles in <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_arc_desc.html" title="Arc descriptor.">Shapes::CArcDesc</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_arc.html" title="Arc shape.">Shapes::CArc</a></code> always have the property that \(0 \leq \alpha_0, \alpha_1 &lt; 2\pi\). As shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig20">Fig. 20</a>, we always store the coordinates of the end points of the arc \(\vec{p}_0\) and \(\vec{p}_1\), respectively, and the tangents to the arc at those points \(\vec{t}_0\) and \(\vec{t}_1\), respectively. To facilitate consistency is maintained when we rotate an arc in <code><a class="el" href="class_shapes_1_1_c_kinematic_arc.html" title="Kinematic arc shape.">Shapes::CKinematicArc</a></code>, the angles, points, and tangents will be stored in private member variables that are updated together automatically using <code>Set</code> functions. This is not formally allowed in our definition of a <a href="../sage/index.html#sec2-2">Descriptor</a>, but as Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "Consistency is the bugbear of tiny minds."</p>

<p>Note that our definition of arc so far is ambiguous: the arc could be either the smaller or larger portion of a circle. Our code will adopt the convention that the arc counterclockwise from \(\vec{p}_0\) to \(\vec{p}_1\). Therefore, flipping the arc from one portion of a circle to its complement means just swapping the angles and swapping and reversing the direction of the normals. For example, in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig21">Fig. 21</a> (left) we have the case that \(\alpha_0 &lt; \alpha_1\), while in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig21">Fig. 21</a> (right) \(\alpha_0 &gt; \alpha_1\).</p>

The trickiest of these is the AABB. Consider the arc shown in <a class="el" href="index.html#fig22">Fig. 22</a>, left. Since none of what we will call <em>quadrant points</em>, the four points on the extreme left, right, top, and bottom of the circle containing the arc (shown in red), then the AABB of the arc (shown in green) is just the smallest AABB that contains the end points of the arc \(\vec{p}_0\) and \(\vec{p}_1\). <a class="el" href="index.html#fig22">Fig. 22</a>, right, shows three arcs that do overlap one or more of the quadrant points. Clearly, their AABBs must be the smallest AABB that includes their respective end points and whichever quadrant points lie on the arc.</p>
